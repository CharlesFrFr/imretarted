# Zombie Server

An open source, performant fortnite backend server with a built in web-interface and desktop launcher!

_Note: Some features are not yet implemented, please see the [Roadmap](#roadmap) for more information._

## Features

- Uses a PostgresQL database to ensure that data is stored securely and quickly.
- Web interface is built with React so users can easily manage their account without having to use the desktop app.
- Admins can manage users and servers from the web interface.
- Desktop app is built with Tauri which allows for a native experience on all platforms.
- Backend (will be) written in Go to ensure that the server is performant and secure.

## Roadmap

- Allow fortnite to interact with the api :)
